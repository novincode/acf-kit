# acf-kit (Meta Package)

**Install all acf-kit packages at once!**

This is a meta-package. Installing `acf-kit` will automatically install all core acf-kit packages:

- [`@acf-kit/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@acf-kit/core)
- [`@acf-kit/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@acf-kit/react)

## Usage

```sh
npm install acf-kit
# or
yarn add acf-kit
# or
pnpm add acf-kit
```

You can then import from the individual packages:

```js
import { something } from '@acf-kit/core';
import { ReactField } from '@acf-kit/react';
```

> **Note:** This package does not export any code. It is for convenience only.
